    Revert "fs/accounting: make edge bandwidth limiters have smaller bursts to make smoother" #4987
    
    This reverts commit 463a18aa0713a55e12e4cb6d201144121fc60ba5.
    
    In practice this caused Windows to have a max bandwidth limit of 8
    MiB/s. This is because of the limited resolution (1ms) of the Windows
    timer.
    
    This needs fixing in a different way.

    fs/accounting: make edge bandwidth limiters have smaller bursts to make smoother
    
    This change decreases the edge limiter burst size which dramatically
    increases the smoothness of the bandwidth limiting.
    
    The core bandwidth limiter remains with a large burst so it isn't
    affected by double rate limiting on the edge limiters.

    fshttp: Obey bwlimit in http Transport - fixes #4395
    
    This change uses the bwlimit code to apply limits to the receive and
    transmit data functions in the HTTP Transport.
    
    This means that all HTTP transactions will have limiting applied -
    this includes listings for example.
    
    For HTTP based transorts this makes the limiting in Accounting
    redundant and possibly counter productive

    azureblob: fix memory usage by upgrading the SDK and implementing a TransferManager
    
    In the Azure SDK there was a bug which caused excessive memory use
    when doing repeated transfers:
    
    https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/issues/233
    
    This patch updates the SDK to v0.13.0 which allowed us to implement a
    custom TransferManager which integrates with rclone's memory pool.
    
    This fixes the excessive memory consumption.

    local: new flag --local-zero-size-links to fix sync on some virtual filesystems
    
    Assume the Stat size of links is zero (and read them instead)
    
    On some virtual filesystems (such ash LucidLink), reading a link size via a
    Stat call always returns 0.
    However, on unix it reads as the length of the text in the link. This may
    cause errors like this when syncing:
    
        Failed to copy: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 13
    
    Setting this flag causes rclone to read the link and use that as the size of
    the link instead of 0 which in most cases fixes the problem.
    
    Fixes #4950

    by injecting time in tests rather than using system time.

    docs: Rewrite rclone filtering documentation
    
    This is an attempt at rewriting the rclone filter documentation page.
    
    I have drawn largely from what appears to be the strong original
    structure of the page; existing text, and forum comments.
    
    The term flag is used throughout rather than differentiating `--`
    options with more complex arguments. That diverges from some standard
    practice but is consistent with messages in the rclone binary and `go`
    documentation.
    
    The term directory not folder is used throughout.
    
    I tried referring to objects more broadly rather than files and it
    just did not seem to work. Apart from a note at the top the
    explanations refer entirely to paths, directories and files. My
    justification is that bucket store users understand the concept of
    files. Not all users of directory aware storage are so familiar with
    objects, keys and metadata.
    
    Many of the changes I have made involve moving issues into what seemed
    to me to be more relevant parts of the original page structure. I
    still find the content repetitious and overly long but that may be
    inevitable when users can only be expected to read the section of the
    page they think most relevant.
    
    I have eliminated the rsync section from the original structure. It is
    hard enough explaining how rclone filters work without also setting
    out how they do not. Comment on sync is instead relegated to a
    paragraph in the directory filter section.
    
    The structure of the page is intended to work with a hugo toc card
    from html Header2 to Header3.
    
    My original intention was to establish a separate examples section. I
    have instead retained examples in each section, added to them and
    tried to make clear what is documentation and what example.
    
    The changes draw on Github and Forum issues too numerous to mention.
    for instance:
    
    https://forum.rclone.org/t/certain-exclusion-flags-seem-to-be-ignored/20049/2
    
    I am **especially** grateful for
    https://forum.rclone.org/t/object-key-remote-directory-filter-clarification/20386/2
    for making sense of directory filters for me.
    
    @ncw has a fun (and useful) online filter app at
    https://filterdemo.rclone.org/ I have not referred to it at this stage
    though I particularly like the fact that it is tied to the same
    codebase as an rclone version.
    
    I have added cautions about mixing the `--filter...` flags with
    `--exclude...` or `--include...`. The same issues seem to arise as
    already recognised between the latter two.
    
    The formal summary of glob syntax introduced at the top of the page is
    shamelessly stolen from https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob
    
    I have tried not to alter too many header descriptions and thereby
    break existing links to them.
    
    The reference to 'lass' in the example has been retained to confuse
    all those not of Scottish or Yorkshire heritage.
    
    Some of my activity was to remove ambiguity and I anticipate
    suggestions to roll that back where it has become overly complex.
    
    I tried particularly to bring together and make clear material about
    directory filters. It was previously scattered throughout the page and
    I couldn't understand it. I am particularly grateful for the
    explanations I received about directory filters though any remaining
    errors are entirely my own.
    
    Removed erroneous references to non existent `--filter...` flags.
    
    In some ways the best person to write this page would be one with no
    knowledge whatsoever of how rclone filters work. The further I got
    into it the better qualified I found myself to be.

    vfs: fix file leaks with --vfs-cache-mode full and --buffer-size 0
    
    Before this change using --vfs-cache-mode full and --buffer-size 0
    together caused the vfs downloader to open more and more downloaders.
    
    This is fixed by introducing a minimum size of 1M for the window to
    look for an existing downloader.
    
    Fixes #4892

    qingstor: fix rclone cleanup
    
    This patch changes to using the default page limit for listing
    unfinished multpart uploads rather than 1000. 1000 is the maximum
    specified in the docs, but setting anything larger than 200 gives an
    error.

    This is because the refresh runs on the root and it isn't a file.

    chunker: improve detection of incompatible metadata #4917
    
    Before this patch chunker required that there is at least one
    data chunk to start checking for a composite object.
    
    Now if chunker finds at least one potential temporary or control
    chunk, it marks found files as a suspected composite object.
    When later rclone tries a concrete operation on the object,
    it performs postponed metadata read and decides: is this a native
    composite object, incompatible metadata or just garbage.

    rcserver: fix 500 error when marshalling errors from core/command
    
    Before this change attempting to return an error from core/command
    failed with a 500 error and a message about unmarshable types.
    
    This is because it was attempting to marshal the input parameters
    which get _response added to them which contains an unmarshalable
    field.
    
    This was fixed by using the original parameters in the error response
    rather than the one modified during the error handling.
    
    This also adds end to end tests for the streaming facilities as used
    in core/command.

    Before this change calling core/command gave the error
    
        error: response object is required expecting *http.ResponseWriter value for key "_response" (was *http.response)
    
    This was because the http.ResponseWriter is an interface not an object.
    
    Removing the `*` fixes the problem.
    
    This also indicates that this bit of code wasn't properly tested.

    serve sftp: fix authentication on one connection blocking others - fixes #4882
    
    Before this change, if one connection was authenticating this would
    block any others from authenticating.
    
    This was due to ssh.NewServerConn not being called in a go routine
    after the Accept call.
    
    This is fixed by running the ssh authentication in a go routine.
    
    Thanks to @FiloSottile for advice on how to fix this.

    ncdu: add empty folder flag into ncdu browser
    
    Implemented empty folder flag for ncdu browser interface. If there is
    empty folder in the list the flag e is prepended before size. If there
    is no empty folder this flag is ommited. It has the same behaviour as
    original ncdu browser. (https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu/man)

    webdav: fix Open Range requests to fix 4shared mount
    
    Before this change the webdav backend didn't truncate Range requests
    to the size of the object. Most webdav providers are OK with this (it
    is RFC compliant), but it causes 4shared to return 500 internal error.
    
    Because Range requests are used in mounting, this meant that mounting
    didn't work for 4shared.
    
    This change truncates the Range request to the size of the object.

    cmd/ncdu: highlight read errors instead of aborting - fixes #4014
    
    When a directory cannot be walk-ed because of a permissions error
    - or any error for that matter -, ncdu mode keeps track of the error
    and highlights directories that could not be read.
    
    Previously, the error would cause ncdu to abort.
    
    Now, directories with unreadable sub-directories are displayed in yellow and
    a message warns that the total may be underestimated.
    
    Unreadable directories themselves are displayed in red along with the error message

    azureblob: fix crash when listing outside a SAS URL's root - fixes #4851
    
    Before this change if you attempted to list a remote set up with a SAS
    URL outside its container then it would crash the Azure SDK.
    
    A check is done to make sure the root is inside the container when
    starting the backend which is usually enough, but when two SAS URL
    based remotes are mounted in a union, the union backend attempts to
    read paths outside the named container. This was causing a mysterious
    crash in the Azure SDK.
    
    This fixes the problem by checking to see if the container in the
    listing is the one in the SAS URL before listing the directory and
    returning directory not found if it isn't.

    Add a download flag to hashsum and related commands to force rclone to download and hash files locally
    
    This commit modifies the operations.hashSum function by adding an alternate code path. This code path is triggered by passing downloadFlag = True. When activated, rclone will download files from the remote and hash them locally. downloadFlag = False preserves the existing behavior of using the remote to retrieve the hash.
    
    This commit modifies HashLister to support the new hashSum method as well as consolidating the roles of HashLister, HashListerBase64, Md5sum, and Sha1sum.  The printing of hashes from the function defined in HashLister has been revised to work with --progress.  There are light changes to operations.syncFprintf and cmd.startProgress for this.
    
    The unit test operations_test.TestHashSums is modified to support this change and test the download functionality.
    
    The command functions hashsum, md5sum, sha1sum, and dbhashsum are modified to support this change.  A download flag has been added and an output-file flag has been added.  The output-file flag writes hashes to a file instead of stdout to avoid the need to redirect stdout.

    fs: Fix parsing of .. when joining remotes - Fixes #4862
    
    Before this fix setting an alias of `s3:bucket` then using `alias:..`
    would use the current working directory!
    
    This fix corrects the path parsing. This parsing is also used in
    wrapping backends like crypt, chunker, union etc.
    
    It does not allow looking above the root of the alias, so `alias:..`
    now lists `s3:bucket` as you might expect if you did `cd /` then
    `ls ..`.

    vfs: make cache dir absolute before using it to fix path too long errors
    
    If --cache-dir is passed in as a relative path, then rclone will not
    be able to turn it into a UNC path under Windows, which means that
    file names longer than 260 chars will fail when stored in the cache.
    
    This patch makes the --cache-dir path absolute before using it.

    b2: Make NewObject use less expensive API calls
    
    Before this change when NewObject was called the b2 backend would list
    the directory that the object was in in order to find it.
    
    Unfortunately list calls are Class C transactions and cost more.
    
    This patch switches to using HEAD requests instead. These are Class B
    transactions. It is then necessary to parse the headers from response
    back into the data that we get from the listing. However B2 returns
    exactly the same data, just in a different form.
    
    Rclone will use the old directory listing method when looking for
    files with versions as these can't be found via a HEAD request.
    
    This change will particularly benefit --files-from, rclone serve
    restic but most operations will see some benefit.

    azure: add support for service principals - fixes #3230
    
    Before: users can only connect to Azure blob containers using the access keys
    from the storage account.
    
    After: users can additionally choose connect to Azure blob containers
    using service principals. This uses OAuth2 under the hood to exchange
    a client ID and client secret for a short-lived access token.

    access tokens, and optionally return refresh tokens.
    
    This patch adds the token_access_type=offline parameter which causes
    dropbox to return short lived tokens now.

    serve http/webdav: redirect requests to the base url without the /
    
    When using `--baseurl` before this patch, if a request was made to the
    base URL without a trailing / then rclone would return a 404 error.
    
    Unfortunately GVFS / Nautilus makes the request without the /
    regardless of what the user put in.
    
    This patch redirects the request to the base URL with a /. So if the
    user was using `--baseurl rclone` then a request to
    http://localhost/rclone would be redirected with a 308 response to
    http://localhost/rclone/

    This change makes Copy use the Rewrite method as suggested by the

    docs: update rclone about docs
    
    Create a full loop of documentation for rclone about, backends overview
    and individual backend pages.
    
    Discussion:
    https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/4774 relates
    
    Previously pull was requested, in part, under ref
    https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/4801
    
    Notes:
    Introduce a tentative draft see-link format the end of sections to try
    rather than lots of in-para links.
    
    Update about.go incl link to list of backends not supporting about.
    
    In list of backends not supporting about, include link to about command
    reference.
    
    I appreciate there may be decisions to make going forward about whether
    command links should be code formatted, and using proper pretty url
    links, but I have fudged that for now.
    
    Update backend pages that do not support about with wording used
    previously for ftp - it is in passive voice but I can live with it. (my
    own wording and fault). The note is applied to a limitations section. If
    one does not already exist it is created (even if there are other
    limitations with their own sections)

    s3: Add MD5 metadata to objects uploaded with SSE-AWS/SSE-C
    
    Before this change, small objects uploaded with SSE-AWS/SSE-C would
    not have MD5 sums.
    
    This change adds metadata for these objects in the same way that the
    metadata is stored for multipart uploaded objects.

    s3: fix hashes on small files with aws:kms and sse-c
    
    If rclone is configured for server side encryption - either aws:kms or
    sse-c (but not sse-s3) then don't treat the ETags returned on objects
    as MD5 hashes.
    
    This fixes being able to upload small files.

    build: Stop tagged releases making a current beta - fixes #4789
    
    Before this change stable releases updated the current beta which mean
    confusingly the current beta release would jump backwards from
    1.54.0-beta to 1.53.3-beta say.
    
    This commit stops any tagged build making a current beta release. They
    will still make beta releases, they just won't update the
    rclone*current*.zip and version.txt files.
    
    This also means that a .0 release will not make a current beta like it
    does at the moment.

    vfs: fix "file already exists" error for stale cache files
    
    Before this change if a file was uploaded through a mount, then
    deleted externally, trying to upload that file again could give EEXIST
    "file already exists".
    
    This was because the file already existing in the cache was confusing
    rclone into thinking it already had the file.
    
    The fix is to check that if rclone has a stale cache file then to
    ignore it in this situation.

    serve restic: implement object cache
    
    This caches all the objects returned from the List call. This makes
    opening them much quicker so speeds up prune and restores. It also
    uses fewer transactions. It can be disabled with
    `--cache-objects=false`.
    
    This was discovered when using the B2 backend when the budget was
    being blown on list object calls which can avoided with a bit of
    caching.
    
    For typical 1 million file backup for a latop or server this will only
    use a small amount more memory.

    Before this change the tests were run against the previous stable

    This unfortunately masked errors in the integration test server.
    
    This change uses the currently installed rclone to run "rclone serve
    ftp" etc. This is installed out of the current code by the integration
    test server so will make a better test.

    vfs: fix virtual entries causing deleted files to still appear
    
    Before this change, if a file was created on a remote but deleted
    externally from that remote then there was potential for the delete to
    never be noticed.
    
    The sequence of events was:
    
    - Create file on VFS - creates virtual directory entry
    - File deleted externally to remote before the directory refreshed
    - Now the file has a virtual add but is not in the listings so will never disappear
    
    This patch fixes it by removing all virtual directory entries except
    the following when the directory is re-read.
    
    - On remotes which can't have empty directories: virtual directory
      adds are not flushed. These will remain virtual as long as the
      directory is empty.
    
    - For virtual file add: files that are in the process of being
      uploaded are not flushed
    
    This patch also adds the distinction between virtually added files and
    directories.
    
    It also refactors the virtual directory logic to make it easier to follow.
    
    Fixes #4446

    onedrive: warn on gateway timeout errors
    
    It seems that when doing chunked uploads to onedrive, if the chunks
    take more than 3 minutes or so to upload then they may timeout with

    mount: implement mknod to make NFS file creation work - fixes #2115
    
    It turns out that NFS calls mknod in FUSE even though we have create
    defined. This was causing EIO errors when creating files.
    
    This patch fixes it by implementing mknod. The way it is implemented
    means that to write to an NFS file system you'll need --vfs-cache-mode
    writes.

    This also adds an alias to the mount command so it responds as `rclone
    cmount` as well as `rclone mount`.

    A security problem was discovered when using set-env and

    introduced.
    
    This patch switches to using the new mechanism which will stop GitHub
    warning about the use of the old mechanism.

    check: make the error count match up in the log message
    
    Before this change we counted the final summary error as an error,
    producing confusing log messages like:
    
        Failed to check with 54 errors: last error was: 53 differences found
    
    This change marks the summary error as already being counted, so the
    error message becomes:
    
        Failed to check with 53 errors: last error was: 53 differences found
    
    This change also returns a listing failure in preference to a summary error.

    sftp: remember entered password in AskPass mode
    
    As reported in
    
      https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4660#issuecomment-705502792
    
    After switching to a password callback function, if the ssh connection
    aborts and needs to be reconnected then the user is-reprompted for their
    password.  Instead we now remember the password they entered and just give
    that back.  We do lose the ability for them to correct mistakes, but that's
    the situation from before switching to callbacks.  We keep the benefits
    of not asking for passwords until the SSH connection succeeds (right
    known_hosts entry, for example).
    
    This required a small refactor of how `f := &Fs{}` was built, so we can
    store the saved password in the Fs object

    local: fix sizes and syncing with --links option on Windows - fixes #4581
    
    Before this change rclone returned the size from the Stat call of the
    link. On Windows this reads as 0 always, however on unix it reads as
    the length of the text in the link. This caused errors like this when
    syncing:
    
        Failed to copy: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 13
    
    This change causes Windows platforms to read the link and use that as
    the size of the link instead of 0 which fixes the problem.

    cmd: make backend env vars show in help as the defaults for backend flags
    
    Before this change
    
        RCLONE_DRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE=111M rclone help flags | grep drive-chunk-size
    
    Would show the default value, not the setting of RCLONE_DRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
    as the non backend flags do.
    
    This change makes it work as expected by setting the default of the
    option to the environment variable.
    
    Fixes #4659

    vfs: Add exponential backoff during ENOSPC retries
    
    Add an exponentially increasing delay during retries up ENOSPC error
    to avoid exhausting the 10 retries too soon when the cache space
    recovery from item resets is not available from the file system yet
    or consumed by other large cache writes.

    vfs: Fix missed concurrency control between some item operations and reset
    
    Item reset is invoked by cache cleaner for synchronous recovery
    from ENOSPC errors. The reset operation removes the cache file and
    closes/reopens the downloaders.  Although most parts of reset and
    other item operations are done with the item mutex held, the mutex
    is released during fd.WriteAt and downloaders calls. We used preAccess
    and postAccess calls to serialize Reset, ReadAt, and Open, but missed
    some other item operations. The patch adds preAccess/postAccess
    calls in Sync, Truncate, Close, WriteAt, and rename.

    vfs: Fix a race condition in retryFailedResets
    
    A failed item reset is saved in the errItems for retryFailedResets
    to process.  If the item gets closed before the retry, the item may
    have been removed from the c.item array. Previous code did not
    account for this condition. This patch adds the check for the
    exitence of the retry items in retryFailedResets.

    vfs: Fix a deadlock vulnerability in downloaders.Close
    
    The downloaders.Close() call acquires the downloaders' mutex before
    calling the wait group wait and the main downloaders thread has a
    periodical (5 seconds interval) call to kick its waiters and the
    waiter dispatch function tries to get the mutex. So a deadlock can
    occur if the Close() call starts, gets the mutex, while the main
    downloader thread already got the timer's tick and proceeded to
    call kickWaiters. The deadlock happens when the Close call gets
    the mutex between the timer's kick and the main downloader thread
    gets the mutex first. So it's a pretty short period of time and
    it probably explains why the problem has not surfaced, maybe
    something like tens of nanoseconds out of 5 seconds (~10^^-8).
    It took 5 days of continued stressing the Close calls for the
    deadlock to appear.

    operations: fix spurious "--checksum is in use but the source and destination have no hashes in common"
    
    Before this change rclone would emit the message
    
        --checksum is in use but the source and destination have no hashes in common; falling back to --size-only
    
    When the source or destination hash was missing as well as when the
    source and destination had no hashes in common.
    
    This first case is very confusing for users when the source and
    destination do have a hash in common.
    
    This change fixes that and makes sure the error message is not emitted
    on missing hashes even when there is a hash in common.

    accounting: stabilize display order of transfers on Windows
    
    Before this change we sorted transfers in the stats list solely on
    time started. However if --check-first was in use then lots of
    transfers could be started in the same millisecond. Because Windows
    time resolution is only 1mS this caused the entries to sort equal and
    bounce around in the list.
    
    This change fixes the sort so that if the time is equal it uses the
    name which should stabilize the order.
    
    Fixes #4599

    vfs: detect and recover from a file being removed externally from the cache
    
    Before this change if a file was removed from the cache while rclone
    is running then rclone would not notice and proceed to re-create it
    full of zeros.
    
    This change notices files that we expect to have data in going missing
    and if they do logs an ERROR recovers.
    
    It isn't recommended deleting files from the cache manually with
    rclone running!

    acounting: fix incorrect speed and transferTime in core/stats
    
    Before this change the code which summed up the existing transfers
    over all the stats groups forgot to add the old transfer time and old
    transfers in.
    
    This meant that the speed and elapsedTime got increasingly inaccurate
    over time due to the transfers being culled from the list but their
    time not being accounted for.
    
    This change adds the old transfers into the sum which fixes the
    problem.
    
    This was only a problem over the rc.

    build: fix architecture name in ARMv7 build - fixes #4571
    
    After introducing the arm-v7 build we are accidentally making debs
    and rpms with the architecture arm-v7.
    
    This fixes the problem by stripping the version off.

    build: fix "Illegal instruction" error for ARMv6 builds - fixes #4553
    
    Before this change we used `go build -i` to build the releases in parallel.
    
    However this causes the ARMv6 and ARMv7 build to get mixed up somehow,
    causing an illegal instruction when running rclone binaries on ARMv6.
    
    See go bug: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41223
    
    This removes the -i which should have no effect on build times on the
    CI and appears to fix the problem.

    vfs: fix spurious error "vfs cache: failed to _ensure cache EOF"
    
    Before this change the error message was produced for every file which
    was confusing users.
    
    After this change we check for EOF and return from ReadAt at that
    point.
